It consists of two sub-parallel right-lateral active fault structures: the primary NNE dipping LRF structure to the north, and a secondary sub-vertical structure to the south, possibly an extension of the Southern Whidbey Island fault (SWIF). The possibility of an earthquake rupture nucleated on the LRF jumping across the step-over and continuing propagation on the SWIF has significant implications for seismic hazard of the populated southern Vancouver area. To study earthquake rupture jumping scenarios across the LRF system, we develop a finite-element model to simulate dynamic ruptures governed by a linear slip-weakening frictional law. The stress perturbations radiated from the LRF rupture will induce an Over Stressed Zone (OSZ, where shear stress exceeds static frictional strength) on the SWIF. With the increase of the OSZ size $R_e$, rupture develops from stopping on LRF (no jumping), to breaking part of the SWIF (self-arresting) or the entire SWIF (break-away). We demonstrate  that rupture jumping scenario is a collective result depending on a range of parameters. Target parameters in our study include fault initial stress level, step-over offset distance and fault burial depth. We find that $R_e$ and the receiver fault stress status are the keystone variables directly controlling rupture jumping scenarios, while other parameters exert their influence by resulting in different $R_e$.</p>

Here we use precise relocations of microseismicity integrated with existing geologic data to present the first identification of subsurface seismogenic structures associated with the Leech River fault zone on southern Vancouver Island. We used the HypoDD double‐difference relocation method to relocate 1,253 earthquakes reported by the Canadian National Seismograph Network catalog from 1992 to 2015. Our results reveal an ~8–10 km wide, NNE dipping zone of seismicity representing a subsurface structure along the eastern 30 km of the terrestrial Leech River fault zone and extending 20 km farther eastward offshore, where the fault bifurcates beneath the Juan de Fuca Strait. Using a clustering analysis, we identify secondary structures within the NNE dipping fault zone, many of which are subvertical and exhibit right‐lateral strike‐slip focal mechanisms. We suggest that the arrangement of these near‐vertical dextral secondary structures within a more general NE dipping fault zone, located 10–15 km beneath the Leech River fault as imaged by LITHOPROBE, may be a consequence of the reactivation of this fault system as a right‐lateral structure in crust with a preexisting NNE dipping structural fabric. Our results provide the first confirmation of active terrestrial crustal faults on Vancouver Island using a relocation method. We suggest that slowly slipping active crustal faults, especially in regions with preexisting foliations, may result in microseismicity along fracture arrays rather than along single planar structures.</p>

In this study, we calculate moment tensors and stress drop values for eight recent induced earthquakes in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin with magnitudes between 3.2 and 4.4, as well as a nearby magnitude 5.3 event that is interpreted as a natural earthquake. We calculate full moment tensor solutions by performing a waveform-fitting procedure based on a 1-D transversely isotropic velocity model. In addition to a dominant double-couple (DC) signature that is common to nearly all events, most induced events exhibit significant non-double-couple components. A parameter sensitivity analysis indicates that spurious non-DC components are negligible if the signal to noise ratio (SNR) exceeds 10 and if the 1-D model differs from the true velocity structure by less than 5%. Estimated focal depths of induced events are significantly shallower than the typical range of focal depths for intraplate earthquakes in the Canadian Shield. Stress drops of the eight induced events were estimated using a generalized spectral-fitting method and fall within the typical range of 2 to 90 MPa for tectonic earthquakes. Elastic moduli changes due to the brittle damage production at the source, presence of multiple intersecting fractures, dilatant jogs created at the overlapping areas of multiple fractures, or non-planar pre-existing faults may explain the non-DC components for induced events.</p>
