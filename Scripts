## About me

Now I am a PhD candidate in geophysics in the [Department of Earth and Planetary Science](http://www.mcgill.ca/eps/) at [McGill University](http://www.mcgill.ca/) since 2014. I received my BSc degree in geophysics from [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn) in July 2014. Currently, Iâ€™m working with my supervisor [Prof. Yajing Liu](mailto:yajing.liu@mcgill.ca) in [McGill Earthquake Process Group](http://eps.mcgill.ca/~crowe/EQprocesses/).

My research interest mainly focus on:
1. Stress drops of fluid induced seismicity in West Canadian Sedimentary Basin(WCSB) area;
2. Upper crustal structures near the Leech River Fault area on southern Vancouver Island area and potential hazard implications.

## Education Background
- Ph.D. candidate, Department of Earth and Planetary Science,  McGill University, 09/2014 - present
- B.Sc. in geophysics, School of the Gifted Young, University of Science and Technology of China, 09/2010-07/2014

## Research
**Stress drops of fluid-induced seismicity in WCSB**
Unlike natural earthquakes, fluid-induced events tend to be characterized by dominant non-DC components. Our study suggests that stress drop calculations should be corrected by the introduction of a non-DC component. Dpending on the non-DC/DC component ratio, the correction results in a stress drop reduction by factors of 1.2 to 6. See [**Zhang et al. [2016]**](/papers/Zhang_et_al-2016-JGR.pdf) for more details.
        
**Earthquake relocation near the Leech River Fault, southern Vancouver Island**
In order to investigate direct seismic evidence for the activity of the Leech River Fault (LRF) and potential active structures nearby, we relocate 1528 events from 1985 to 2015 using a double difference method. Relocation results suggest there is a 30km long northeast dipping structure underlying the surface of the LRF. Some fine scale structures embedded within the picture are also depicted. Our study also shows a marked difference in the seismic activity between western and eastern segments of the LRF. We propose that the LRF east and west segments should be treated separately in earthquake hazard assessment. See [**Li et al. [2016]**](/papers/Li_et_al-2016-GRC-Abstract.pdf) for more details.
